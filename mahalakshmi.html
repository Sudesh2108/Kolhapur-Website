        <p>Ambabai Temple (also known as Mahalakshmi Mandir) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Adi Shakti, who is believed to reside there as Supreme Mother Mahalakshmi and is worshipped by locals as Ambabai. Mahalakshmi is part of the Tridevi, the triumverate of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, and Mahasaraswati, symbolizing the three Supreme Goddesses.

            It is a customary practice among Hindus to embark on a yatra (pilgrimage) to various temples, including the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Kolhapur Mahalakshmi Temple, and Padmavathi Temple. Goddess Lakshmi is the consort of Lord Vishnu and it is customary among Hindus to visit Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Kolhapur Mahalakshmi Temple and Padmavathi Temple as a yatra (pilgrimage). These temples holds great significance as shakti peethas (where the divine goddess Shakti's cosmic power is believed to reside). It is believed that undertaking a pilgrimage to these temples can help attain Moksha (Salvation).</p><br>
            <h3>History</h3><br>
            <p>The temple belongs architecturally to the Chalukya empire and was first built in the 7th century.[6] The temple is referred to in multiple Puranas. There is evidence to show that the Konkan king Kamadeo, Chalukyas, Shilahara, Yadavas of Devagiri dynasties visited this city. Adi Shankaracharya also visited. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj ruled this area and they also visited the temple regularly.

                In 109 CE, Karnadeo cut off the jungle and brought the temple to light. The existence goes back to the 8th century, according to Bhandarkar and Khare.[who?] Itihāsa Chakra indicates that the temple dates back to Mahājanapadā times. In the 8th century, the temple sank down due to an earthquake. In the 9th century, King Gandavadix extended the temple by building Mahakali Mandir. During 1178–1209, in the reign of Raja Jaysing and Sindhava, South gate and Atibaleshwar Temple were built. In 1218, Yadav king Tolum built Mahadwar and offered jewels to Devi. Further, Shilaharas built Maha Sarasvati Mandir. He, being a Jain got 64 idols carved. It is possible that a new idol called Padmavati was installed at that time. Historian Paul Dundas in his book The Jains[7] mentions that Mahalaxmi temple Kolhapur was a Jain temple.[8][9] Sheshashayee Vishnu which is an octagonal structure closer to the eastern gate has a panel of 60 Jain Tirthankaras carvings.[10][11] Jains worshipped the idol in the temple as Padmalaya or the abode of Padma or Padmavati, an epithet of Goddess Lakshmi.[12] Further, in Chalukya times, Ganapati before the temple was installed. In the 13th century, Shankaracharya built Nagar Khana and Office, Deepmalas.</p>
